🚀 Key Concepts & Features
🧠 AI-Assisted Coding (Local LLMs)
Local LLM Integration via Ollama: Code suggestions, bug detection, and readability improvements are powered by local Large Language Models (LLMs) including CodeLLaMA and Mistral, helping you optimize and refactor code—never sending your code to the cloud.

Privacy and Security: All AI inference happens locally for true data privacy; code never leaves your device or private network.

🔐 Secure Coding Workflow
Real-Time Vulnerability Detection: On every code run or scan, Dev_IDE checks for OWASP Top 10 threats, insecure coding patterns, and logical vulnerabilities.

AI-Powered Remediation: Every flagged issue comes with AI-generated reasoning and tailored fix suggestions, making secure development accessible and actionable.

✨ Code Enhancement & Live Execution
Performance and Readability Recommendations: Dev_IDE automatically refactors code for clarity, modularity, performance, and reduced redundancy using smart AI logic.

Multi-Language Compilation: Live code execution is available in over 40 languages through efficient API integrations (Judge0/Piston)—results delivered in real-time for a true interactive workflow.

📄 Professional Reporting & Documentation
PDF Report Generation: Export AI-reviewed code, security findings, and optimization advice in clean, paginated PDF reports. All exports use Node.js streams for fast, reliable delivery and metadata timestamping.

Organized Feedback: Reports include code snapshots, vulnerability overviews, performance tips, and language metadata for traceability.

🛡️ Security by Design
Input Validation: All form/API payloads are checked for structure, size, and sanitized against known exploits.

Security Headers & CORS: Security-focused HTTP headers and CORS policies restrict API exposure to trusted frontends, blocking common web-based threats and improper cross-origin access.

Rate Limiting: All heavy endpoints (file upload, scan, AI calls) are guarded by rate limiting to prevent DoS, brute-force, or excessive resource use.

Private Workspace: No code or data ever leaves your machine/cloud, and every inference, scan, and report is run inside local, controlled environments.

Extensible Security: Plugin-based vulnerability modules are being developed, allowing customizable scanning and remediation logic.
